# Build a specific Chromium version of Fortress into its OWN tree/out/bundle, so multiple
# versions (e.g. 149 stable + 151 latest) coexist without clobbering each other.
#
# Usage:  build/build-version.sh <chromium-version> [platform]
#   e.g.  build/build-version.sh 149.0.7827.200 linux-x64
#         build/build-version.sh 151.0.7922.138   linux-x64
#
# Each version gets its own workdir  .fortress-build-<major>/  (each needs ~100GB + hours).
# The patch series is 3-way applied; if a patch fails on an older/newer tree, re-anchor it
# (see DUAL_VERSION_BUILD.md) and re-run.
